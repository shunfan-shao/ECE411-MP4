Progress Report
  For this checkpoint,
    Matthew worked on the Forwarding System
    Yvonne worked on the hazard detection and branch prediction systems
    Shunfan worked on the Arbiter
  
  Testing Strategies
    We used the test code given to us and analyzed the waveforms of certain signals and registers to debug it.
  
  Power and Timing analysis
      Slow 900mV 100C Model. Max Frequency: 112.23MHz
      Total Power: 449.66mW   Dynamic Power: 77.27mW   Static Power: 322.27mW   I/O Power: 50.12mW
Roadmap
  Advanced Features planning
    Matthew will plan to focus on branch detection by implementing a local branch history table and a global 2-level branch history table that serve as inputs
      to a tournament branch predictor and pair that with a return address stack to help improve branch accuracy
